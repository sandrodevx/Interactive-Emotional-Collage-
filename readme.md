## Description
This project is an interactive web application that creates a digital art collage based on your emotions. By selecting your current mood, colorful shapes (circles and triangles) are generated and float upwards with hypnotic movements. The app also keeps a history of your moods, stored locally in your browser.

## Features
- **Interactive Mood Buttons**: Choose from four emotions: Happy, Sad, Calm, and Excited.
- **Dynamic Art Generation**: Each emotion triggers unique shapes and colors.
- **Real-Time Animation**: Shapes float and rotate smoothly on the screen.
- **Mood History**: Your selections are saved in the browser's local storage.

## How It Works
1. **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page, including the canvas for drawing and buttons for mood selection.
2. **CSS**: Styles the page, making it visually appealing and responsive.
3. **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for generating shapes, animating them, and saving mood history.
